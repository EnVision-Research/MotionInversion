 we present a novel approach to motion customization in video generation, addressing the widespread gap in the thorough exploration of motion representation within video generative models. Recognizing the unique challenges posed by video's spatiotemporal nature, our method introduces **Motion Embeddings**, a set of explicit, temporally coherent one-dimensional embeddings derived from a given video. These embeddings are designed to integrate seamlessly with the temporal transformer modules of video diffusion models, modulating self-attention computations across frames without compromising spatial integrity.  Furthermore, we identify the **Temporal Discrepancy** in video generative models, which refers to variations in how different motion modules process temporal relationships between frames. We leverage this understanding to optimize the integration of our motion embeddings.


<h4>Customize the motion in your videos with less than 0.5 million parameters and under 10 minutes of training time.</h4>

## Installation

```bash
# install torch
pip install torch torchvision

# install diffusers and transformers
pip install diffusers==0.26.3 transformers==4.27.4
```
Also, xformers is required in this repository. Please check [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers) for detailed installation guidance.

## Training

To start training, first download the [ZeroScope](https://huggingface.co/cerspense/zeroscope_v2_576w) weights and specify the path in the config file. Then, run the following commands to begin training:

```bash
python train.py --config ./configs/train_config.yaml
```

Stay tuned for training other models and advanced usage!

## Inference
After cloning the repository, you can easily load motion embeddings for video generation as follows:

```python
import torch
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline
from diffusers.utils import export_to_video
from models.unet.motion_embeddings import load_motion_embeddings

# load video generation model
pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("cerspense/zeroscope_v2_576w",torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe.enable_model_cpu_offload()

# memory optimization
pipe.enable_vae_slicing()

# load motion embedding
motion_embed = torch.load('path/to/motion_embed.pt')
load_motion_embeddings(pipe.unet, motion_embed)


video_frames = pipe(
    prompt="A knight in armor rides a Segway",
    num_inference_steps=30,
    guidance_scale=12,
    height=320,
    width=576,
    num_frames=24,
    generator=torch.Generator("cuda").manual_seed(42)
).frames[0]

video_path = export_to_video(video_frames)
video_path
```
Please note that it is recommended to use a noise initialization strategy for more stable outcomes. This strategy requires a source video as input. Click [here](./noise_init/) for more details.
Then you should pass the `init_latents` to `pipe` using the `latents` argument:
```python
video_frames = pipe(*,latents=init_latents).frames[0]
```
